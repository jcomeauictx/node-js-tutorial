code from https://www.airpair.com/javascript/node-js-tutorial

I put "Apache" as the license but honestly I have no idea.

## Run this program:

- `npm start`: starts the server
- `chrome http://localhost:1337`: views the report
- `chrome http://localhost:1337/tpx.gif`: creates a new report row
- Refresh the `tpx.gif` page, then go back to the report to see the new line.
- `npm stop`: shuts down the server
